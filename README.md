# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 
- MongoDB

## Capabilities

Currently the page design is not responsive. However, it is able to post tweets to database and fetch existing tweets without refreshing the page.
